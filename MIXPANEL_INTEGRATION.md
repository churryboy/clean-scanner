## Testing Mixpanel Integration

### Manual Testing

1. **Open Browser Console**
   ```
   Look for: "üìä Mixpanel initialized successfully"
   ```

2. **Perform Actions**
   - Each action should log: "üìä Event tracked: [Event Name]"

3. **Check Mixpanel Dashboard**
   - Go to mixpanel.com
   - Navigate to Live View
   - Verify events are appearing in real-time

### Test Checklist

- [ ] All properties have correct values

---

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Appearing

1. **Check Console**
   ```javascript
   // Should see:
   üìä Mixpanel initialized successfully
   üìä Event tracked: [Event Name] {...}
   ```

2. **Verify Token**
   ```javascript
   console.log(CONFIG.MIXPANEL_TOKEN);
   // Should show: 296b1b87e332df523af59a12b0c04c45
   ```

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for requests to `api.mixpanel.com`
   - Verify 200 OK responses

4. **Ad Blockers**
   - Some ad blockers block Mixpanel
   - Test in incognito mode
   - Whitelist mixpanel.com

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in config.js:
```javascript
mixpanel.init(CONFIG.MIXPANEL_TOKEN, {
    debug: true,  // Change to true
    // ...
});
```

## File Structure

```
/image-upload-simple
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                    # Environment variables (Mixpanel token)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore              # Ignore .env file
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js               # Configuration with Mixpanel token
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Mixpanel SDK included
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js                  # Analytics module and event tracking
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MIXPANEL_INTEGRATION.md # This file
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Security Best Practices

### Protecting the Token

1. **Never commit .env to git**
   ```bash
   # Already in .gitignore
   .env
   ```

2. **Use environment variables in production**
   ```javascript
   // For server-rendered apps:
   const token = process.env.MIXPANEL_TOKEN;
   ```

3. **Rotate token if exposed**
   - Go to Mixpanel project settings
   - Generate new token
   - Update .env file

### Client-Side Security

**Note**: Since this is a client-side application, the Mixpanel token will be visible in the browser. This is acceptable because:

1. Mixpanel tokens are **project-specific**, not account-specific
2. They only allow sending events, not reading data
3. Mixpanel has rate limiting and abuse protection

However, for additional security:
- Monitor for unusual activity in Mixpanel
- Use Mixpanel's IP allowlist feature if needed
- Implement backend validation for critical events

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions

1. **A/B Testing**
   ```javascript
   mixpanel.track('Experiment Viewed', {
       'Variant': 'A',
       'Experiment': 'Button Color Test'
   });
   ```

2. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Track user cohorts (e.g., by school, grade)
   - Analyze retention by cohort

3. **Feature Flags**
   - Use Mixpanel for feature rollouts
   - Track feature usage

4. **Session Tracking**
   ```javascript
   analytics.track('Session Started');
   // Track session duration
   ```

5. **Error Tracking Integration**
   - Integrate with Sentry or similar
   - Link Mixpanel events to error reports
